# React Bank Application

This was a simple application that I made to teach myself React.
The application facilitates the front-end of a banking application, while the back-end is simulated using the `json-server` package.

## Log-in Screen

This is the first screen that the user sees when entering the application. The user is prompted for their login information, which is then checked with data stored in the database. If the user does not have an account, they can create a new one. Once the user logs in, they will be able to either log out, look at their open accounts, or transfer between accounts.

## Accounts Screen

The accounts screen lists a few items. All of the user's active cards are available to be interacted with. The user can delete their cards or add a new card.

## Transfer Screen

The transfer screen allows the user to transfer money between their cards and cards of every other user.
